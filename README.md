This project represents the FullStack assessed activity for the subject Lab III of the Computer Engineering Program of the 
Engineering Program of the Faculty of Science and Technology of the Universidad Centroccidental "Lisandro Alvarado", Venezuela. 

## Getting started üöÄ

The application developed with React Native and Expo for the frontend and, Node.js and Express for the backend also makes use of other libraries that are necessary for the proper functioning of the practice in question. As for the Database Management System, Mongo ATLAS was implemented for NoSQL statements with MongoDB.

### Prerequisites üìã

* Node.js version 16.15.0

* Expo client

* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for HTTP requests.

* For the project, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used as text editor for both frontend and backend, but any text editor can also be used.

* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_footprint_row_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624584&adgroup=115749713703) as DBMS.

### Installation üîß

To begin, we proceed to download the repository. To do this, we open the console, go to the folder where we want to save the project and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/gustavoerivero/Flymagine-frontend.git
```

Next, go to the cloned folder in the "Flymagine-frontend" repository.

For a Windows operating system, with the command:

```
cd Flymagine-frontend
```

Next, we proceed to the installation of the libraries and dependencies necessary for its execution.

```
npm install
```

If it doesn't work, try with:

```
npm i -f
```

Once the installation of the dependencies is successful, the project is ready to deploy.

## Deployment üì¶ 

To perform a local deployment, we proceed by executing one of the following commands:

With expo:
```
expo start
```

After this, a screen will be displayed in console indicating the different methods to run the server. For the development of the project, it was done by emulating the application from android.
